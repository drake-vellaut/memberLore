	"text":"Things never truly change.\n\nNo matter how much people try and do the right thing, there is always someone with more power, more influence that can derail the best.\n\nShae's TPL was the best idea, truly groundbreaking and gave us years of a well run organization. But as the TPL grew, so did the many people who wanted to seek to influence the TPL missions.\n\nScience was being influenced by outside forces, missions being chosen for reasons outside of facts. I left my families foundation to get away from the politics, to do good in this universe...true good. And that was the TPL...but Shae is only one person.\n\nA handful of us have seen the writing on the wall, and while we have agreed the TPL has been the oppurtunity of our lives. It is now bound by bueuracratic tape. Scientific innovation cannot thrive under these conditions, just like I believe it failed for my families foundation...no matter how much money it made my family.\n\nI have had intial conversations with the group, and it seems like most of them are onboard with starting a group with a pure science focus or a focus on the facts and the science to help drive innovation...in a world that feels starved for scientific innovation that was not created by the...old ones.\n\nThis new union is our chance to create a lasting legacy for the universe, I will fight for everything to ensure this union maintains its own autonomy...never to be influenced by the politics and powers of the universe. Humankind needs innovation else we will be controlled. This union is the first step for humankind to innovate in ways humans have not seen...and most importantly we shall do this the right way, standardize the science and safeguard it from outside influence. We cannot let greed infiltrate the union, as greed destroys the greatest of ideas. \n\nI hope the conversations go well...",
