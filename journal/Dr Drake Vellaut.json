It had been a while since Drake had seen this powerful of a storm, rain falling so hard you could barely see a few meters in front of you. Drake was looking out the small window of an outpost on a remote planet. He had come to investigate…\n\nDrake’s holodevice lite up and started to emit a ringing sound on the nearby desk. The ringing took his attention away from looking out into the maelstrom. He stopped in his tracks when he saw the name come across the holodevice…Roarke.\n\nAfter a few moments Drake moved closer and clicked a button on the holodevice that brought up a holographic image of a Gertan in tactical gear. Drake clicked another button and a camera contraption popped up from the device and a faint blue light was emitting from it projecting Drake’s holoimage to Roarke.\n\n“Hey Roarke…How” Drake started before the Gertan interrupted him. Roarke skipped the normal pleasantries and got straight to the point.\n\n“Doc, we need to meet – its urgent. I am already in route to you, I assume you are still in the Elisium system since we only just talked last week about what you were doing there” Roarke said.\n\nDrake’s demeanor immediately changed. Drake usual calm was shaken, if Roarke said something was urgent then it was urgent. They had been through quite a lot together in the past back.\n“Ya I’m still here, I’ll send my coordinates. Is there anything that can be said over this line?” Drake said with his mind spinning.\n\nThe Gertan shook his head no. “I know you don’t drink Doc, but I’d get a bottle out cause even if you are not then I am going to.”\n\nThe call ended. Drake sat down. Roarke was a good friend that he spent almost a decade with running many different missions for the let’s just say the TPL. They had been through a lot of dangerous situations, and the urgency with this brought up some of those memories. Something was wrong, especially if he couldn’t say over an open line.\n\nIt was only a few hours later when the outpost door opened and an extremely large Gertan walked through the door. They gave each other a hug, and Roarke set his bottle down on the table.\n\n“I wish this was under better circumstances Doc, but there is some shit going down. An artifact is losing its mind and just eating worlds and it is heading straight toward Pyromycis and Mycityum.” Roarke said pouring some of his drink into a glass that he grabbed off of the counter. Roarke gestured the glass to Drake, who shook his shook his head in disbelief.\n\nMycityum was a marvel of a GUNC outpost, a lot of work had been put into creating this outpost to allow many people safety and capabilities to conduct their work, research, or many other exploration activities. And with an artifact heading toward Pyromycis, it was only a matter of time this artifact was looking to become bigger.\n“How much time is there?” Drake was trying to go through all the scenarios in his head and none of them seemed to have a great outcome.\n\n“A day, maybe two at most. I’m sorry couldn’t give you a more headsup, we just found out about this ourselves. And negotiations with the Servitors…well they failed as you expect as anything to do with their precious old ones they don’t care about how much human life is destroyed” Roarke said with palpable frustration.\n\n“Not great news, but that at least gives us a bit of time, it could have been hours. This at least gives me some hope…” Drake said as his mind trailed off.\n\n“You all have that GAIA Class, where is it stationed? Can it make it to Pyromycis in time?” Roarke asked.\n\n“It’s in civilized space back at the conservatory. It can make it, but it probably will be late.” Drake said. Moving to grab his holo device and started to type.\n\n    *Secure Transmission ID: 247821*\n\n    *Secure Connection Established*\n\n    *[Send to all necessary parties for awareness]*\n\n    *This is Dr. Drake Vellaut. We need instant mobilization of the GAIA Class Cruiser for an immediate evacuation mission. Small crew recommended as time is of the essence. Location for mission is Rodin System: Pyromycis.*\n\n   *Prepare other ships in case another situation arises while GAIA is out.*\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    *Send Transmission*\n\nThe message was sent. Drake could feel the weight of this situation, he could only hope that the mobilization could happen quick enough. After Drake sent the message he turned back to Roarke.\n\n“I can’t thank you enough, we may just be able to save a bunch of lives with the time you have given us Roarke,” Drake said.\n\n“You would do the same for me if you knew something would save lives and I could do something about it. You know the bureaucracy is filled with red tape but we have ways of getting information to those who can help. If the Servitors don’t value life, then we need to look out for ourselves cause no one else will,” Roarke said. “Oh and Doc, the Clave is aware of the artifact…”\n\nThe Clave methodologies were…interesting. And this situation was not the time for wildcards, when lives were at stake.\n\n“I just hope the Clave doesn’t touch that artifact, if they destroy or even harm it in anyway. The Servitors will bring down the wrath of the old ones and just assume the TPL had a hand in it, and more lives could be lost,” Drake said.\n\n“Ill keep an eye on the situation, Im going dark on my comms. But if more shit goes down ill be just be over at the TPL Starbase in the Akacala System not too far away. Hopefully I’ll see you there with some good news and we can catch up with some old friends. All the Speed to you doc.”\n\nRoarke was gone, left only his empty bottle. \n\nDrake needed to get off planet and monitor the situation as if the Clave was involved things could get even worse. \n\nAnd so Drake gathered his items and was set off toward the Rodin system, he would get there much slower than the GAIA cruiser would but it was unknown what type of situation was going to happen.",
